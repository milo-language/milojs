# milojs: object footprint

## Measured

Measured with `/usr/bin/time -l`, 50,000 iterations each, differences against a
baseline of 50,000 numbers pushed into an array. Re-measured 2026-08-15:

| what | cost | was (2026-07-30) |
|------|------|------|
| baseline (50k numbers in an array) | 34.2 MB | 19.1 MB |
| per empty object `{}` | **337 bytes** | 1008 bytes |
| per added property `{a:1}` | 130 bytes | 145 bytes |

## Why it shrank: the side table landed

The plan this document used to describe is done. `JSObj` carried 42 fields
because every optional capability was inline: promise state, bound-function
state, proxy target and handler, Map/Set backing, typed-array view, ArrayBuffer
bytes, regex id, date, node-api wrapper. A plain `{}` paid for all of them, and
an object with no properties at all cost a kilobyte.

Those fields now live in `JSObjExtra`, a side table reached through a single
`extra` index on `JSObj`. Current shape, counted from `src/runtime.milo`:

| | fields |
|---|---:|
| `JSObj` (the hot header) | 28 |
| `JSObjExtra` (the side table) | 26 |

The header keeps what a plain object actually touches: `props`, `elems`,
`holes`, `logicalLen`, `proto`, `ctor`, the boolean brand flags the dispatcher
tests on the hot path, `extra`, and the collector's `mark` and `free` bits.
Everything a plain object never becomes is one index away instead of inline.

The measured per-object cost still exceeds the struct's own width because the
object arena grows by doubling, so live objects sit in an array carrying up to
2x headroom.

The current hot header also carries one `logicalLen` integer. It is `-1` for an
ordinary dense array and records only an implicit sparse tail, preventing a huge
`array.length` assignment from allocating one value and hole record per index.
Far-out elements use numeric entries in the already traced property bag.

Expected: roughly 3-4× less per empty object. Verify by re-running the
measurements above rather than by inspection.

Note the ordering constraint: the promise waiter table added for await
suspension already lives outside `JSObj` for this reason — see
[milojs-async-suspension.md](milojs-async-suspension.md).


## Measured 2026-07-20, engine built from main (bf294dc)

`/usr/bin/time -l`, maximum resident set, baseline (3.6 MB for a
`console.log(0)` script) subtracted:

| program | RSS | per object |
|---|---|---|
| 50k `{}`      | 64.6 MB | **1279 B** |
| 50k `{a:1}`   | 71.5 MB | **1424 B** |

The often-quoted figure for this work is ~968 B per empty object. The real
number is **1279 B**, about 32% worse, so the case for the side table is
stronger than the plan assumed, not weaker. One property costs a further 145 B.

Whoever picks this up should re-measure rather than trust either number: both
are RSS deltas over a 50k-object loop, which also pays for the backing array and
allocator slack, and neither is a direct `sizeof`.

### Where it goes

`JSObj` carries 28 scalar fields, 5 `Vec` fields and 3 `JSValue` fields inline.
Every object pays for every optional capability: promise state and reactions,
bound-function target/this/args, proxy target/handler, Map/Set key and value
vectors, typed-array view fields, ArrayBuffer bytes.

An empty object uses none of them. The plan stands: move the rare groups
(promise, bound, proxy, map/set, typed-array, arraybuffer) to side tables keyed
by object index, leaving the common object — props, elems, proto, ctor and the
handful of flags — in the inline struct.

### Sequencing note

This is a wide refactor of the hottest struct in the engine, touching allocation,
the collector's mark phase and every capability check. The await-suspension work
this week produced two changes that passed the full fixture suite and still
broke the real app, so the order that actually catches things is: change, then
`tests/run.sh`, then GC stress, then tahoeroads — before believing any of it.

## Execution design (added 2026-07-20, for the fresh session that lands this)

Concrete finding: the Map/Set group alone is **73 accessor sites** (63 in
src/eval.milo, 10 in src/runtime.milo). Every rare field is like this — moving one to a
side table is a mechanical but large rewrite of its access sites. Milo has no
property getters, so `st.objects[o].mapKeys` cannot transparently redirect; each
site must change. Budget for it; don't expect a small diff.

**Side table shape.** One `HashMap<i64, CapData>` per capability, keyed by object
index (sparse — only objects that use the capability have an entry). E.g.
`mapData: HashMap<i64, MapData>` with `struct MapData { keys: Vec<JSValue>, vals:
Vec<JSValue> }`. The old `isMap` boolean becomes `st.mapData.has(o)`.

**Accessors.** Add helper fns so sites change uniformly and once: `mapDataOf(st,
o): &mut MapData` (inserts an empty entry on first use for a set-path), and
read-only `isMapObj(st, o): bool`. Convert each site to the helper — grep-driven,
one capability at a time.

**GC (the one subtle part).** The collector currently marks the JSValue-bearing
rare fields (`mapKeys/mapVals`, `boundTarget/boundThis/boundArgs`, `proxyTarget/
proxyHandler`, `promiseValue/reactions`) from inside `JSObj`. After the move it
must instead iterate each side table and mark the entries of LIVE (marked)
objects. Miss one table and you get a use-after-free that only shows under GC
stress — so run `MILOJS_GC_THRESHOLD=1` on every slice.

**Slicing order (each slice: change → run.sh → GC-stress → app smoke → commit).**
1. **Proxy first** — rarest, self-contained, only get/set/has/ownKeys touch it.
   Proves the pattern with the least blast radius.
2. typed-array + arraybuffer (`bytes`, `taBuf/taKind/taOffset/taLen`, `abMax*`).
3. bound-function (`boundTarget/boundThis/boundArgs/boundMethod`).
4. Map/Set (the 73-site one).
5. date, regexId, napi — small, easy.
6. **promise LAST** — the most common capability and the most entangled (await
   suspension, reactions, the resolver-native id scheme). Most care, do it once
   everything else is proven.

Re-measure `50k {}` after each slice; the empty-object number should fall toward
the ~74-byte hot header as promise/bound/proxy/map/ta drop out.

### GC lifecycle of a side table (subtle — do not skip)

A side table `HashMap<i64, CapData>` keyed by object index has TWO GC duties, not
one:

1. **Mark**: iterate the table and mark the JSValues (target/handler, keys/vals,
   promiseValue/reactions…) of entries whose object is live. (The obvious one.)
2. **Sweep-remove**: when the collector FREES an object index `o`, it must delete
   `sideTable[o]`. Object indices are recycled from the free-list, so a stale
   entry left behind makes the NEXT object allocated at `o` silently inherit the
   freed object's capability — a plain `{}` reusing a proxy's old slot would test
   as a proxy. This only manifests under GC + allocation churn (a recycled index
   that happens to reacquire a rare capability), so it passes casual testing and
   fails under `MILOJS_GC_THRESHOLD=1` with a workload that frees and reallocates
   rare-capability objects. Every slice's GC-stress test MUST exercise that.

Also confirm the language has a usable `HashMap<i64, T>` (the design assumes one);
if not, a parallel `Vec` indexed by object id with an `Option`/sentinel works but
wastes the sparsity — prefer the map.

### Refinement: keep the 1-byte flags inline, move only the large fields

The sweep-remove hazard above is AVOIDABLE. Keep the capability booleans
(`isProxy`, `isMap`, `isBound`, `isDataView`, `promiseState` sentinel…) INLINE on
JSObj — they are 1 byte and are reset to their empty value by the newObject
literal when an index is recycled, so they correctly gate access. Move only the
LARGE fields to side tables: the 32-byte JSValues (`promiseValue`,
`boundTarget/boundThis`, `proxyTarget/proxyHandler`) and 24-byte Vecs
(`reactions`, `boundArgs`, `mapKeys/mapVals`, `bytes`). Those are ~90% of the
movable bytes; the flags are noise.

Why this is safer:
- A stale side-table entry (dead proxy's index not yet reused) is never READ,
  because the inline `isProxy` flag on whatever now occupies that index is false.
  When the index is reused as a new proxy, `setProxy` overwrites the entry. So
  **no sweep-remove is required for correctness** — the flag does the gating.
- GC still marks LIVE entries only: iterate each side table, and for an entry
  whose object is currently marked, push its JSValues onto the existing mark
  worklist (same as today's inline `pushMarkTargets(proxyTarget)`, just sourced
  from the table). A stale entry's object is unmarked, so its value is not marked
  and is free to collect; the dangling handle in the stale entry is never read.

Net: the per-slice work becomes mechanical field-access rewrites + one
mark-worklist pass per table, with NO new sweep logic. Sweep-removing stale
entries is then a pure memory optimization (bound the tables), not a correctness
requirement — do it later if the tables grow.

### Slice-order caveat: several rare capabilities are app-critical

The proxy mark path is load-bearing for the integration app — prisma wraps its
client in a Proxy, and the existing comment on the proxy mark records that
dropping it "silently lost every property the moment a second client was
constructed." So a subtle GC error in the proxy slice breaks priority-1, and GC
bugs of that kind can pass a smoke test and only surface under specific
alloc/collect timing. Same goes for bound (zod pre-binds) and likely Map. So:
run the FULL app (not just the self-fetch guard) under the moved slice, and run
GC stress with a workload that constructs/drops many of that capability. Given
the stakes, the memory refactor is best done with fresh context, one slice at a
time, app-verified — not rushed.

### CRITICAL: weigh access FREQUENCY, not just object count (found before coding the proxy slice)

A HashMap side table is sparse (memory win) but every access to a moved field
costs a hash lookup + a copy of the CapData struct out of the map. So moving a
field trades a per-OBJECT memory saving for a per-ACCESS time cost. That is only
a win when the capability is rarely ACCESSED, not merely rare in count.

Two capabilities are rare in count but HOT in access, and must NOT be
naively side-tabled:
- **proxy** — prisma wraps its client in a Proxy, so every client property read
  goes through the proxy get trap; a hash lookup + 64-byte copy per property
  access would slow the app's hottest path.
- **promise** — async-heavy code touches promiseState/promiseValue constantly.

A Vec-indexed side table (O(1), no hash) does NOT fix this: indexing by object id
needs one slot per id including non-proxies, which re-inflates every object — the
opposite of the goal. Sparse storage inherently requires a lookup.

Revised guidance: side-table the rare-AND-cold capabilities first — typed-array
view fields, ArrayBuffer `bytes`, `date`, `regexId`, `napi` — and MEASURE the
empty-object win those alone buy. Only consider proxy/promise/bound after
measuring their access-cost hit on the FULL app (not a microbench), and be
prepared to leave the hot ones inline. The headline "1.3 KB → ~350 B" assumed
moving all 28 fields; if the hot ones stay, the realistic target is higher but
the app stays fast. Net: this refactor needs a measure-first spike, not a
blind move-everything pass.

## Measure-first spike done (2026-07-21) — the strategic call

Re-measured on the engine, `/usr/bin/time -l`, delta over a `console.log(0)`
base of 3.75 MB:

| program | RSS | per object |
|---|---|---|
| 50k numbers | 7.42 MB | 73 B/slot |
| 50k `{}`    | 69.34 MB | **1311 B** |
| 50k `{a:1}` | 76.55 MB | +144 B/prop |

Confirms ~1279–1311 B/empty. The number is real and worth attacking.

**The win is in the HOT fields — this is the decision that matters.** Of the
~465 B struct, ~250 B is the promise/proxy/bound/map payloads (5 JSValues +
several Vecs); only ~90 B is cold scalars (typed-array view i64s, ArrayBuffer
`bytes`, regexId, dateMs, napi). So:

- **Cold-only slice** (ta/ab/date/regex/napi): saves ~90 B of struct → after the
  arena's ~2.75× headroom, roughly 1311 → ~1050 B measured. A real but modest
  ~20% win, and a wide refactor for it.
- **Hot-field slice** (proxy/promise/bound/map payloads): where the 3-4× lives.

**The access-frequency objection is defused by the flags-inline refinement
above, and that reconciles this section with the "proxy first" slice order.**
Keep the 1-byte flags/sentinels inline (`isProxy`, `isBound`, `promiseState`,
`isMap`); move only the large *payloads* to side tables. Then the hot GATE checks
— `isPromise` on every await, `isProxy` on every property read — stay inline
field reads. A side-table lookup is paid only when the flag is already true, i.e.
only for a genuine proxy/promise/bound object, on a path (trap dispatch,
promise settle) whose cost already dwarfs a hashmap probe. Store handles (i64
object indices), not 32-byte JSValue copies, so the lookup returns 8 bytes.

**Reconciled slice order** (supersedes both the "proxy first" list and the
"cold first" caveat, which were written at different times):
1. Prove the pattern on ONE cold group with a real payload — ArrayBuffer `bytes`
   (a 24 B Vec, genuinely cold: the app touches it only in fetch-body decode).
   Smallest blast radius, exercises mark + the flags-inline gate end to end.
2. typed-array view fields + `date` + `regexId` + `napi` — remaining cold.
3. **bound** payload (`boundTarget/boundThis/boundArgs/boundMethod`) — zod
   pre-binds; flag `isBound` stays inline.
4. **proxy** payload (`proxyTarget/proxyHandler`) — app-critical (prisma); flag
   `isProxy` stays inline; run the FULL app, not just the self-fetch guard.
5. **map/set** payload (`mapKeys/mapVals`) — the 73-site one.
6. **promise** payload (`promiseValue/reactions`) LAST — most entangled; sentinel
   `promiseState` stays inline so `isPromise` stays a field read.

Every slice: change → `tests/run.sh` → `MILOJS_GC_THRESHOLD=1` stress that
constructs+drops many of that capability → app smoke → re-measure `50k {}` →
commit. Expect the empty-object number to barely move until the hot payloads
(steps 3-6) land — that is where the 250 B lives.

## BLOCKER found 2026-07-21: HashMap.get deep-clones, and the Vec payloads are where the bytes are

Checked the side-table primitive before coding slice 1. `HashMap<i64, T>`
exposes only New / Insert / Get / GetOrDefault / Contains / Remove / Len. **`get`
and `getOrDefault` DEEP-CLONE the value** — the codegen comment is explicit:
"Deep-clone, don't `load`: a shallow copy aliases the map's heap." There is no
`getMut`/`entry`/reference accessor, and there cannot cleanly be one: Milo's
second-class references forbid returning `&V`, which is exactly *why* `get`
clones. This constraint was not in the plan above, and it reshapes the refactor:

- **The big movable payloads are Vecs, and Vecs cannot be cheaply moved.**
  `bytes` (typed-array/DataView element access, per-element), `mapKeys/mapVals`
  (per Map op), `reactions`, `boundArgs` — reading any of these from a side table
  clones the whole Vec; mutating is clone-out → mutate → clone-back. A
  `Float64Array` write loop or a growing Map becomes **O(n²)**. Non-viable while
  the primitive clones. These are ~120 B of the struct — and, kept inline, an
  unused Vec is just 24 B with no heap, so leaving them inline is cheap anyway.
- **Only the JSValue payloads (~160 B: proxy/promise/bound targets) and the
  scalars (~72 B: ta view i64s, regexId, dateMs, napi, abMaxLen) are movable**,
  paying a bounded 8–32 B clone per access, guarded by an inline flag. Storing an
  object *index* (i64) instead of a full JSValue where the value is always an
  object (proxyTarget, boundTarget) shrinks that clone to 8 B.

**Revised achievable target: ~2×, not 3–4×.** Moving the JSValue payloads +
scalars takes the ~465 B struct to ~233 B → roughly 1311 → ~650 B/empty measured.
The remaining halving the plan assumed lived in the Vec payloads, which the
primitive blocks.

**And the ~2× requires touching the app-critical paths.** The movable JSValue
payloads are proxy (prisma wraps its client — every property read), promise
(async-heavy) and bound (zod). The clone cost is tolerable (dominated by trap
dispatch / settle), but a GC-mark or flag-gating slip there breaks priority-1,
and it can only be *confirmed* by running the full app, which needs the private
bundle. So the high-value part of this refactor is gated on app-in-the-loop
verification that the milojs session cannot do alone.

**Three ways forward, in rough ROI order:**
1. **Deprioritize memory; spend the effort on QuickJS/generators (item 3),** which
   don't touch the app's critical path and move a headline number. The empty-
   object cost is real but the app already runs fast (~34 ms/route); 1.3 KB/object
   is not what's hurting it.
2. **Land only the safe scalar slice** (ta view fields + regexId + dateMs + napi +
   abMaxLen, ~72 B, all cold, no GC-mark duty since no JSValues, fixture-
   verifiable without the app) for a modest ~10–15 % win that proves the side-
   table infra. Leave the JSValue payloads for an app-in-the-loop session.
3. **Add a mutable-map-access primitive to Milo** (`getMut`/`entry` returning a
   borrowable slot) so Vec payloads become movable and the full 3–4× is back on
   the table. This is a language/compiler change gated by second-class-reference
   rules — the biggest investment, but it's the only path to the original target
   and it helps every Milo program, not just milojs.

## Measured 2026-07-30, after the extra table and the accessor split

Both side tables have landed. `JSObjExtra` holds the rare object capabilities
(`JSObj.extra` indexes it), and getter/setter pairs moved out of `Prop` into
`Interp.accessors`, a generational `std/arena` — an accessor property now stores
a `Handle<Accessor>`, and a property that outlives its slot reads as `None`
instead of picking up whichever accessor recycled the slot.

`/usr/bin/time -l`, maximum resident set, 50k iterations, deltas over a 50k-number
array baseline (17.8 MB):

| what | before | after | note |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| per empty object `{}` | 1279 B → 328 B | **328 B** | `JSObjExtra` split, already landed |
| per property `{a:1}` | 145 B | **113 B** | getter/setter (64 B) out of `Prop` |

The accessor split measures 97 B/property with a plain index key; the
generational handle costs the extra 16 B. Worth it: a recycled accessor slot is
exactly the failure a raw index cannot detect, and the property bag is copied
around by the evaluator.

`objDeleteKey` and the `array.length` truncation path also stopped rebuilding the
property bag by deep-cloning every survivor (a key string plus three JSValues
each) — they use `Vec.remove`, which moves the element out.

Next, in ROI order: `holes` (24 B, rare) into `JSObjExtra`, then the 19 inline
bools into one bitfield (~16 B). Neither is worth breaking the object header's
hot path for; re-measure before starting.
